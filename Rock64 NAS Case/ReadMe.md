A NAS case for the Pine Rock64 board (https://www.pine64.org/?product=rock64-media-board-computer) by Pine64
The case has space for the mainboard, two 2.5" disks, two USB to SATA adapters and a small USB3-Hub. 
With my Openmediavault setup i get about 80MB/Sec read and 90MB/Sec write.
Without the USB-hub i get slightly better numbers (about 5%).

The case is based on the "Rock64 case" by Arcade_Machine
