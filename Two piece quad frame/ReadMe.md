Simple two piece quad frame.
The frame is 170mm and uses 4" props. (in my case 4045 4-blades)

I wanted a frame for some old 1806 motors and other disused parts.
But any motors that can swing a 4" prop and matching ESC and FC will do.

The height 8 standoffs needs to be adapted to match the height of the PDB and any components below it.

I used the following parts.
DYS BE1806

Micro Camera and VTX

You will need a XT60 connector, 12* M3 10mm bolts, 4 longer M3 bolts with nuts for mounting the PDB and FC and mounting hardware  for your motors.

The receiver is and old 6 channel FlySky that had its plastic cover removed
But any 4+ channel receiver will do.

I am using cleanflight with stock PIDs
On a 3s 1300mAh LiPo it´s not super fast and i don´t think my setup will handle 4s

The pictures are from a earlier version.

After some testing and a number of quite hard caches (on grass) i can confirm that the frame can take some serious abuse!
